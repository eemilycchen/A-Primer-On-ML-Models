Schedule for Time of Completion
| Week   | Objectives | Actions | Notes and Resources |
|--------|-------|----------|----------|
| 1  | Complete the comprehensive schedule that outlines the start and finish of the project.   | 1. Use [DSC 190 Introduction to Data Mining](https://shangjingbo1226.github.io/teaching/2022-winter-DSC190-DM) as the backbone of ML techniques to cover. <br> 2. For each technique, watch relevant lectures and storytell the technique through a jupyter notebook. <br> 3. Use [CS224n: Natural Language Processing With Deep Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1214/index.html#schedule) to go into the depth of learnning more about natural language processing. <br>        |         |
